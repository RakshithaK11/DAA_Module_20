# EX 2B BACKTRACKING - NQUEEN PROBLEM
## DATE:
## AIM:
To solve the N-Queen problem using backtracking, which places N queens on an N*N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.


## Algorithm
1.Start placing queens column by column from the first column (leftmost).
2.Check if placing a queen at (row, col) is safe (no queen in same row, upper-left diagonal, or lower-left diagonal).
3.If safe, place the queen at (row, col) and recursively attempt to place the rest.
4.If placing leads to a dead end, backtrack by removing the queen and try the next row.
5.Print the board if all queens are placed, otherwise report no solution exists.
